## Approach

* Created a custom shape `tl` (timeline) using the template provided on the [tldraw docs](https://tldraw.dev/examples/shapes/tools/shape-with-geometry#:~:text=Slideshow-,Shape%20with%20geometry,-This%20file%20demonstrates)
* `tl` takes `parts` as a prop and uses it to determine length of timeline and number of elements it has.
* Value for `parts` is accepted from user and passed to `tl` when the Generate button is clicked.
* User can click Generate Again to generate new timeline.
